# Smart Symptom Classifier

An interactive machine learning app that predicts potential diseases based on selected symptoms using a trained Random Forest classifier. Built with Streamlit for real-time predictions and beautiful UI enhancements.

**Live App**: [Click here to try it!](https://smart-symptom-classifier-demo.streamlit.app/)  
**Dataset**: [Kaggle - Disease Symptom Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset)

## What I Learned...

This project helped me explore:

- Binary symptom encoding for structured ML input  
- TF-IDF vs binary features in medical classification  
- Streamlit for clean app UI + real-time feedback

## Next Steps

- Add patient demographic input (age, gender)
- Integrate `symptom-severity.csv` for weighting
- Explore deep learning (e.g. BERT for symptom descriptions)
